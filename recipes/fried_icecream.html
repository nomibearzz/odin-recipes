        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This fried ice cream is crunchy outside and smooth and creamy inside. Serve with whipped cream, honey, and cherries.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>1 quart vanilla ice cream</li>

            <li>3 cups crushed cornflakes cereal</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

            <li>3 egg whites</li>

            <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            
            <li>Scoop ice cream into eight 1/2-cup-sized balls.</li>

            <li>Place on a baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 1 hour.</li>

            <li>Combine cornflakes and cinnamon in a shallow dish. Beat egg whites until foamy in a separate bowl.</li>

            <li>Roll ice cream balls in egg whites.</li>

            <li>Then in cornflakes, covering ice cream completely. Repeat if necessary. Freeze again until firm, about 3 hours.</li>

                
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large, heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Using a basket or slotted spoon, fry ice cream balls 1 or 2 at a time in hot oil until golden, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>

            <li>Drain quickly on paper towels and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Editor's Note</h3>

        <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.</p>
