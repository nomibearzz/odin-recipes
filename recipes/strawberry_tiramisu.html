        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love traditional Italian tiramisu but I have a young child so I created a version without eggs or alcohol! My tiramisu combines fresh strawberries, cream cheese, and whipped cream and can be made in advance.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>3 ½ cups fresh strawberries, hulled, divided</li>
            <li>7 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>2 lemon, juiced, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>½ (12 ounce) package ladyfinger cookies, or more as needed</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>


            <li>Reserve 3 or 4 strawberries for the garnish. Slice 1/2 of the remaining strawberries and place in a bowl with 2 tablespoons sugar and the juice of 1 lemon. Stir to combine and set aside.</li>

            <li>Transfer remaining strawberries into a blender. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar and remaining lemon juice. Blend until smooth.</li>


            <li>Transfer strawberry puree to a small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring often, until thickened to a sauce-like consistency, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and add more sugar if strawberry sauce is not sweet enough. Add some water if sauce is too thick. Remove from heat and let cool completely.</li>

            <li>Combine cream cheese and 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Whip cream in a separate bowl until soft peaks form. Fold into the cream cheese mixture.</li>

            <li>Arrange ladyfingers snugly in a single layer inside a square glass dish. Pour 1/2 of the strawberry sauce over the ladyfingers. Spread 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture on top. Scatter 1/2 of the marinated sliced strawberries onto the cream cheese mixture. Repeat layers with remaining ladyfingers, sauce, and sliced strawberries. Spread the remaining cream mixture evenly over the top; garnish with the reserved strawberries.</li>

            <li>Cover tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
        
        <ul>

            <li>You could use Italian mascarpone instead of cream cheese if you prefer.</li>

            <li>You can prepare this tiramisu up to 48 hours in advance. Decorate with fresh strawberries before serving. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 1 or 2 days, depending on when you made it!</li>

        </ul>
